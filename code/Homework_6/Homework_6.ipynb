They are rankings from 1 to 10 on the overall quality and condition of the home, respectively. As a ranking of 10 (very excellent) should contribute more to the value of a home than a ranking of 1 (very poor), it is an acceptable approximation to keep these as numeric factors rather than use `get_dummies` and add another 18 factors to our model. However, this means the relationship within OverallQual and OverallCond will be forced to be linear among the rankings and may not represent its real impact on value.
